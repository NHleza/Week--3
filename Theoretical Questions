### Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

**Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?**

- **Primary Differences:**
  - **Computation Graph:** PyTorch uses *dynamic computation graphs* which are built on-the-fly, making it more flexible and easier to debug. TensorFlow traditionally uses *static computation graphs* that are defined before execution, which can be optimized for performance but are less intuitive to modify during runtime.
  - **Ease of Use:** PyTorch offers a more *Pythonic syntax* and is generally considered easier for beginners and researchers. TensorFlow has a steeper learning curve but provides a comprehensive ecosystem including tools like TensorFlow Serving for deployment.
  - **Community & Ecosystem:** TensorFlow has a larger, more mature community and extensive production-ready tools. PyTorchâ€™s community is rapidly growing, especially in research.
  - **Deployment:** TensorFlow supports multiple languages (Python, C++, Java) and has built-in deployment tools, making it ideal for production environments. PyTorch is often preferred for prototyping and research.

- **When to Choose:**
  - Choose **PyTorch** for rapid prototyping, research projects, and when ease of debugging and flexibility are priorities.
  - Choose **TensorFlow** for production-grade applications, large-scale deployments, and when cross-platform support or integration with other languages is required[1][2][4][5][6].

**Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.**

- **Interactive Experimentation:** Jupyter Notebooks allow data scientists and AI engineers to write and execute code in small chunks, facilitating step-by-step experimentation, visualization, and debugging during model development.
- **Documentation and Collaboration:** Notebooks combine code, visualizations, and rich text explanations, making them ideal for documenting workflows, sharing results with team members, and enabling reproducible research and collaborative development[Assignment Context].

**Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?**

- **Advanced Linguistic Features:** spaCy provides pre-trained models for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and Named Entity Recognition (NER), which are far more accurate and efficient than simple string operations.
- **Efficiency and Scalability:** spaCy is optimized for performance and can process large volumes of text quickly, whereas basic string operations are slow and error-prone for complex NLP tasks.
- **Ease of Use:** spaCy offers a clean API and built-in pipelines that abstract away low-level text processing details, enabling developers to build robust NLP applications with less effort[Assignment Context].

| Aspect               | Scikit-learn                                            | TensorFlow                                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Target Applications** | Classical machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. | Deep learning and neural networks, including CNNs, RNNs, and transformers for complex tasks like image recognition and NLP. |
| **Ease of Use for Beginners** | Very beginner-friendly with simple APIs and extensive documentation; ideal for quick prototyping and classical ML. | Steeper learning curve due to complexity; however, Keras integration simplifies model building. Requires understanding of computational graphs. |
| **Community Support** | Large and mature community focused on classical ML, with many tutorials and integrations. | Very large and active community with extensive resources, especially in deep learning research and production deployment. |

**Summary:**  
Scikit-learn is best suited for classical machine learning tasks and is highly accessible to beginners. TensorFlow is designed for deep learning applications and excels in scalability and production deployment but requires more expertise to master[Assignment Context][1][5].
